            <h1>Crohn’s Assistant</h1>
            <p>Crohn’s Assistant is a mobile application for people who suffer from Crohn’s inflammatory bowel disease.
                The main objective of the application is to automatically identify and alert the appearance of a
                possible outbreak of the disease based on certain sets of symptoms referred by specialists. In addition,
                it provides the user with an orientative access to reference recommendations on disease management,
                endorsed by medical societies.</p>

            <h2>Outbreaks</h2>
            <p>This is a post about my participation in the IV Health and Wellness Fair called Pontesán in Galicia. This
                year’s focus was on nutrition and fighting obesity and it had over 40 non-profit entities participating.
                I had the honor of presenting my mobile application called Crohn’s Assistant which helps patients manage
                their Crohn’s inflammatory bowel disease more effectively and improve their quality of life. The app has
                been very well received and has received a lot of positive feedback since its launch 10 months ago, with
                a total of 450 downloads to date (May 2023).</p>
